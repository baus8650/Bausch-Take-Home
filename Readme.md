# Welcome to my unnamed recipe app

This app was built to practice API calls to themealdb.com to list the recipes organized into categories. Future work on this app will be converting the original MVC design to MVVM in an attempt to present this app as a portfolio piece to future employers. 

The search functionality currently accepts multiple queries (separated by a space) of both full and partial words. As of right now, the search only applies to categories and I am currently working out a way to toggle to search for meals individually.

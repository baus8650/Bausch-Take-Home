# Welcome to my unnamed recipe app

This app was built to practice API calls to themealdb.com to list the recipes organized into categories.

The search functionality currently accepts multiple queries (separated by a space) of both full and partial words. As of right now, the search only applies to categories and I am currently working out a way to search for meals independant of categories.

Future work on this app will include overall UI/UX Improvements for a more attractive and aesthetically pleasing app.
